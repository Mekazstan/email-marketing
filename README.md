# Email Marketing Agent

### Problem:
Cold emails and cold calls often suffer from low engagement rates because they lack personalization. A generic approach fails to resonate with different prospects. Prospects from different industries have unique concerns, and manual segmentation is slow, making it hard to scale outreach.

### Task:
Develop an AI-driven cold email workflow for an insurance company that dynamically personalizes messages based on the prospect’s industry, engagement level, and potential objections.

- Input: A list of company names (prospects) and their respective fields (e.g., Engineering, Fashion, Commerce).
- Output: A cold email tailored to the recipient’s industry, previous engagement level, and potential objections; and an advise to you on how to further engage the client.

### Branching Logic:
Industry-based Personalization
- If the prospect is in tech, emphasize innovation.
- If the prospect is in finance, emphasize security & ROI.
- If the prospect is in healthcare, emphasize compliance & efficiency, etc.
